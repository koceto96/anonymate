# Anonymate
A privacy preserving data extractor written in `Python`.

## Description

A facility that takes a large dataset of people's personal information and anonymises it up to a state, where it is impossible to distinguish between the people. However, it also preserves the data's structure and 'sense', which will allow for meaningful data science experiments. There are a lot of unexplored structure preserving algorithms in Mathematics that will be used for the task at hand, one simple example being the Chinese Remainder Theorem while more advanced studies might involve Group/Category theory.
